## General introduction

In metagenomics all genetic material (DNA) in a sample matrix is sequenced and analyzed. Culture-dependent methods have obvious biases in microbial ecology, while uncultured taxa comprise a large fraction of microbial communities in complex ecosystems. For this reason, metagenomics has become a widely used tool for the analysis of microbial communities. Metagenomics has also many benefits compared to amplicon sequencing, as it gives information not only on the taxonomic diversity but also on the functional composition of microbial communities. Recent bioinformatic developments now allow the recovery of metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) at an incredible depth.

During this course the students will learn state-of-the-art bioinformatic approaches to analyse metagenomic data. The course covers both read-based and assembly-based methods, focusing on the strenght of each of these methods depending on the research question. Short-read sequencing technologies are still commonly used in metagenomics, but recent technical advances in long-read sequencing technologies are making long-read sequencing a valid option in metagenomics. Data originating from both short- (e.g. Illumina) and long-read (e.g. Nanopore/PacBio) sequencing platforms will be used in this course to demonstrate their advantages and disadvantages in metagenomics and microbial ecology.

Many things are possible thanks to the support from [CSC](http://www.csc.fi).
